*"Clip, record, sample, and playback... **on any audio device**!"*

Sound Deck is a plugin for the Elgato Stream Deck designed to provide advanced audio clip control, audio capture, sampling, and audio playback... on any audio device; this makes Sound Deck a fantastic pairing with the Elgato Wave, or any other audio device provider, such as the GoXLR or Voicemeter.

## <img src="./assets/clip.svg" width="20" alt="Clip Audio Action" /> Clip Audio

Think Twitch clips, but audio only, simple! The Clip Audio action lets you record the last _x_ seconds of audio for any of your computer's audio devices. After activating the action, the audio is clipped, and saved to the **Output Path** as an MP3/WAV file. Tip: this works great for recording silly moments in party chat!

| Option | Description |
--- | ---
Capture Device | The audio device to create clips from; this can be either an input (e.g. microphone) or output (e.g. speaker, headphone, etc.) device connected to your computer.
Duration | The length of the audio clip; can be 15 / 30 / 60 / 90 / 120 seconds.
Output Path | A directory path where audio clips should be saved to.
Encode to MP3 | When checked, audio clips are encoded to MP3; otherwise audio clips are saved as WAV.
Normalize Volume | When checked, volume levels within the audio clip are normalized. This can reduce excessive peeking, but might reduce overall volume in some scenarios.

## <img src="./assets/play.svg" width="18" alt="Play Audio Action" /> Play Audio

Like the default _play audio_ action, but with more options and hype! The Play Audio action lets you play a list of audio files in the order you want, on the audio device you want. The action also lets you control how clips are played, via the **Action** option.

| Option | Description |
--- | ---
Playback Device | The audio device to play clips on; this can be any output (e.g. speaker, headphone, etc.) device connected to your computer.
Action | The action to take when the button is pressed.<br />**Play / Next** plays the next track, stopping the current track if one is playing.<br />**Play / Stop** plays the next track, or stops the current track if one is playing.<br />**Play All / Stop** plays the playlist from the next track, or stops playback if a track is playing. *(coming soon)*<br />**Loop / Stop** loops  the next track, or stops the current track if one is playing.<br />**Loop All / Stop** loops the playlist from the next track, or stops playback if a track is playing. *(coming soon)*<br />**Loop All / Stop (Reset)** loops the playlist from the first track, or stops playback if a track is playing. *(coming soon)*
Order | Defines the order the audio files are played in; can be either **Random** or **Sequential**. Please note, when **Sequential** is selected, files can be re-ordered manually.
Files | The playlist of audio files to play. Files can be added by selecting `Add file...`, removed by pressing the X, or re-ordered (when **Order** is **Sequential**) by dragging the bullet point up/down.

## <img src="./assets/record.svg" width="20" alt="Record Audio Action" /> Record Audio

The Record Audio action lets you record an audio device for any duration of time. Press once to start recording, press again to stop recording, easy! After recording, audio clips are saved to the **Output Path** as an MP3/WAV file.

| Option | Description |
--- | ---
Capture Device | The audio device to listen to; this can be either an input (e.g. microphone) or output (e.g. speaker, headphone, etc.) device connected to your computer.
Output Path | A directory path where audio clips should be saved to.
Encode to MP3 | When checked, audio clips are encoded to MP3; otherwise audio clips are saved as WAV.
Normalize Volume | When checked, volume levels within the audio clip are normalized. This can reduce excessive peeking, but might reduce overall volume in some scenarios.

## <img src="./assets/sampler.svg" width="20" alt="Sampler Action" /> Sampler

*Coming Soon.*

The Sample action lets you quickly record a sample, and then play it back. Press-and-hold to start recording, and upon release the sample is saved. Pressing the button after again plays back the sample. Similar to the Play Audio action, there are multiple playback actions available.

## <img src="./assets/clear-sampler.svg" width="20" alt="Clear Sampler Action" /> Clear Sampler

*Coming Soon.*

The Clear Sampler action lets you easily delete samples saved on a button. Activate the Clear Sampler button and then press the sample you wish you clear, and like magic, it's gone. The Clear Sampler action will de-activate after removing the sample, allowing you to record another one.

N.B. Clearing a sample does not delete it from the **Output Path**.

*There are no options associated with the Clear Sampler action.*

## <img src="./assets/stop.svg" width="20" alt="Record Audio Action" /> Stop Audio

*Coming Soon.*

The Stop Audio action lets you quickly and easily stop all audio currently being played through Sound Deck. This can be particularly useful if a Play Audio action is being played from a Multi-Action.

*There are no options associated with the Stop Audio action.*
