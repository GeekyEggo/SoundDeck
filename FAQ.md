## What operating systems are supported?
Currently Sound Deck supports Windows 10, and requires [Microsoft .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) runtime.

## I see an exclamation mark when I press an action
This indicates an error has occurred with the plugin; restarting the Stream Deck application usually resolve most errors. If the problem persists, please consider [creating an issue](#how-do-i-create-an-issue-or-request-a-feature).

## Clicking the directory button doesn't do anything
The button _should_ open a dialog that lets you choose a folder; if it appears nothing has happened, the dialog might just be hiding behind the Stream Deck window.

## Audio clips are really quiet
The volume of audio clips are currently normalized within Sound Deck; I intend to make this configurable within future releases; if you'd like to see this sooner, please let me know.

## How do I create an issue or request a feature?
You can submit an issue or request a feature on ![issue-icon] GitHub, [here](https://github.com/geekyeggo/sounddeck/issues). Please be as descriptive as possible, and include any log files with issues as they are incredibly helpful when figuring out what went wrong. Logs can be found in `%APPDATA%\Elgato\StreamDeck\logs`, and will be named `com.geekyeggo.sounddeck#.log`, where `#` is a number (the latest log file is enough).
