## Frequently Asked Questions
If you have a general question about Sound Deck, please [contact me](https://twitter.com/geekyeggo) on Twitter.

## Requirements
- Windows 10.
- [Microsoft .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework) runtime.

## Common Problems

#### _"I see an exclamation mark when I press an action"_
This indicates an error has occurred within the plugin; restarting the Stream Deck application usually resolve most errors. If the problem persists, please consider creating an issue.

#### _"Clicking the directory button doesn't do anything"_
The button _should_ open a dialog that lets you choose a folder; if it appears nothing has happened, the dialog might just be hiding behind the Stream Deck window.
